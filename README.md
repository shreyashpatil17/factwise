90% of the project is done as there was a time limit.

Whats Half-Working?
1) The Delete Button :- The delete operation is being performed successfully with no flaws. There is just one design change that i was not able to do and that is the custom dialog box, due to time restrictions and that was to be designed from Scratch. So i used a the window.confirm method and it works.

Whats not working? 
1) Edit option :- It is not working as If i had worked on that then the time limit would have be exceeded
